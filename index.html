        <h2>Deppbot was retired on 31 Dec 2018</h2>
        <p>Deppbot will be shuttering its service on 31 Dec 2018. After which, all data will be deleted and login will
          be disabled.</p>
        <p>It's been an interesting journey for Deppbot..</p>
        <p>When Deppbot started, it was ahead of its time and "Continuous Update" as a process was relatively new.</p>
        <p>Since then, the concept of keeping your code/dependencies updated (especially to keep your product safe of
          security vulnerabilities) has caught on with many forward-looking companies and many similar services have
          also sprouted. Deppbot is proud to have been part of this history.</p>
        <p>However, I am unable to focus my energy on Deppbot at the moment and so it's been extremely difficult to keep
          Deppbot running..</p>
        <p>Hence the most appropriate thing to do is to shutter the service for now.</p>
        <p>Thank YOU for your patience and support, and I hope Deppbot was useful to you in some ways.</p>
        <p>So long.</p>
